For a polished and visually engaging `README.md`, you can include icons to make sections stand out. Below is your `README.md` with relevant icons using Markdown formatting. You can use icons from services like [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons) or [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/) for easy integration. I‚Äôve added some example icons below:

# ü§ñ Dialogflow Chatbot Server

This project is a simple Express.js server that integrates with Google Dialogflow for processing chatbot messages. The server handles incoming requests, sends them to Dialogflow for intent detection, and responds with the chatbot's reply.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before running the server, ensure you have the following:

- **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your system.
- A **Dialogflow account** and a created chatbot project.
- **Google Cloud credentials** JSON file for your Dialogflow project.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ChatBot-AI.git
cd ChatBot-AI
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Setup Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your Dialogflow project ID and the path to your Google Cloud service account JSON file.

Example `.env`:

```env
DIALOGFLOW_PROJECT_ID=your-dialogflow-project-id
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="C:/path/to/your/service-account-file.json"
```

- **DIALOGFLOW_PROJECT_ID**: Your Dialogflow project ID.
- **GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS**: The path to your Google Cloud service account credentials file (JSON format).

### 4. üöÄ Running the Server

To start the server, run the following command:

```bash
node server.js
```

The server will start and listen for incoming requests on the default port `5000` (or the port specified in your environment variable).

### 5. üí¨ Using the `/chat` Endpoint

You can now send POST requests to the `/chat` endpoint with a JSON payload containing a `message` field. The server will forward this message to Dialogflow and return the chatbot's reply.

#### Example Request:

```bash
POST http://localhost:5000/chat
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "message": "Hello"
}
```

#### Example Response:

```json
{
  "reply": "Hi there! How can I assist you today?"
}
```

### ‚è≥ Rate Limiting

The server implements rate limiting to prevent overloading Dialogflow with too many requests. The default rate limit is set to 5 requests per minute per IP.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling

If there is an error with the request or an issue with the Dialogflow API, the server will return a 500 status code along with an error message.
